## Variable

Used to store and represent data in a memory
2 types
  1. System defined:- defined by system on the bash shell(env or printenv)
  2. User defined:- defined by the user in script

Syntax
Variable_name=data(int,string,char,array,null,bool)
No space around `=`

Key Commands for Managing Variables
- env – show environment variables
- printenv – print environment variables (all or specific)
- set – show all shell + environment variables + functions
- unset – remove a variable
- export – make a variable available to sub-shells

Properties
```
Overwritable
```

Variable naming convension
```
Contain letter,number,underscore.
Start with underscore(_),latter(a..z,A..Z).
Case-sensitive
No whitespace, special char
purposeful name
no reverse keyword(if,do,then,for,while,else,fi,done,set,case etc)
```
Allowed
```
mahin
MAHIN
Mahin
Mahin_RAZA
Mahin_
mahin123
_MAHIN
```

Not allowed
```
3MAHIM
MAHIN@RAZA
```

Export
```
export MAHIN=raza #avail to all sub shell sessions
echo "export MAHIN=raza" >> ~/.bashrc  #avail to all shell sessions
```

ECHO
```
echo $MAHIN
echo ${MAHIN}
echo $MAHIN_RAZA #wrong❌
echo ${MAHIN}_RAZA #right✔️
echo $0 #Displays the name of the current shell or the name of the script being executed.
echo $? #Exit code of last command
echo $$ #Give process id of current shell

```

✅ To see all variables currently set in your shell:

```bash
set        # shows all shell + env variables + functions
printenv   # shows environment variables only
env        # another way to show environment variables
```

### Variable Defining in Script
```
#!/bin/bash
# User defined variables

echo "This is User Defined Variables example:-"
echo

FIRST_NAME="Ram"
LAST_NAME="Misra"

echo "My name is $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME."
exit 118
```
```
#!/bin/bash
var1="Devil"
var2=23
readonly var1
echo $var1 $var2
var1=23
echo $var1 $var2
```

To get the lenght of the variable value
```
variableName=value
echo ${#variableName}
```
```
#!/bin/bash
# String length example

str="GeeksForGeeks"
echo "The string is: $str"
echo "Length of string: ${#str}"
```

Assigning String Variables in Bash
- No spaces are allowed around the = sign.
- You can use either single quotes ', double quotes ", or no quotes if no spaces/special characters.
```
VariableName='value'
echo $VariableName        # prints value

VariableName="value"
echo ${VariableName}      # prints value

VariableName=value
echo "$VariableName"      # prints value
```
```
var1="Hello"
var2="World"
var3="!"

var=$var1$var2$var3
echo $var
```
```
var="${var1}**${var2}**${var3}"
echo $var
```
```
var=$var1 $var2 $var3   # ❌ Bash thinks $var2 is a command!
echo "${var1} ${var2} ${var3}"
```
