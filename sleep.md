## ðŸ”¹ 1. Using `sleep` in terminal
- Linux commands can run one after another or at the same time, but sometimes a delay is needed between commands.
- The sleep command pauses command execution for a specified time, which is useful when timing affects the correctness or success of subsequent operations.
- The command accepts delays in seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d), providing flexibility.
- By using sleep in scripts, users can automate tasks more effectively and prevent system overloads or command failures due to premature execution.<img width="677" height="126" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6844054d-bdd3-4f45-a8be-8ec3e4e4b32b" />


`sleep` pauses execution for a given amount of time.

Examples:

```bash
sleep 5        # sleep for 5 seconds
sleep 2m       # sleep for 2 minutes
sleep 1h       # sleep for 1 hour
sleep 0.5      # sleep for half a second
```

You can test it by running:

```bash
echo "Start"; sleep 3; echo "End"
```

ðŸ‘‰ Output:

```
Start
(3 sec pauseâ€¦)
End
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Using `sleep` inside a Bash script

Example script (`myscript.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Step 1"
sleep 2
echo "Step 2 (after 2 seconds)"
sleep 3
echo "Step 3 (after 3 more seconds)"
```

Run it:

```bash
bash myscript.sh
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Sleep in loops

`sleep` is often used inside loops to slow down execution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
    sleep 1   # wait 1 second before next iteration
done
```

Output:

```
Iteration 1
(wait 1 sec)
Iteration 2
(wait 1 sec)
...
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Sleep with fractional seconds

Bash supports floating-point sleeps:

```bash
sleep 0.2   # 200 milliseconds
```

---

âœ… In short:

* Use `sleep N` to pause execution.
* Time units: **s (default), m, h, d**.
* Works both interactively and inside scripts.
