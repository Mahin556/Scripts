Got it 👍. Based on the requirements and the steps shown in your image, here’s the **complete working Bash script** for creating a new user with an auto-generated password, setting the password, and forcing the user to change it at first login:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script should be executed with root privileges
if [[ "${UID}" -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Please run with sudo or root."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if at least one argument is provided
if [[ "${#}" -lt 1 ]]; then
  echo "Usage: ${0} USER_NAME [COMMENT]..."
  echo "Create a user with name USER_NAME and optional COMMENT."
  exit 1
fi

# Store the first argument as the username
USER_NAME="${1}"

# The rest of the arguments are treated as comment
shift
COMMENT="${@}"

# Generate a random password
PASSWORD=$(date +%s%N)

# Create the user with the comment and home directory
useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}

# Check if user was successfully created
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "The account could not be created."
  exit 1
fi

# Set the password for the user
echo ${PASSWORD} | passwd --stdin ${USER_NAME} &>/dev/null

# Check if password was set successfully
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Password could not be set."
  exit 1
fi

# Force password change on first login
passwd -e ${USER_NAME} &>/dev/null

# Display the username, password, and hostname
echo
echo "Username: ${USER_NAME}"
echo "Password: ${PASSWORD}"
echo "Host: $(hostname)"
```

✅ This script will:

* Exit if not run as root.
* Require at least one argument (`username`).
* Treat any extra arguments as a comment.
* Auto-generate a random password.
* Create the user with home directory.
* Assign the password and enforce a change at first login.
* Display username, password, and host info.

Perfect 👍 Let me explain this script **step by step** in simple words:
---

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

* This line tells the system to use **bash shell** to run the script.

---

```bash
if [[ "${UID}" -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Please run with sudo or root."
  exit 1
fi
```

* `${UID}` is a special variable that stores the **current user’s ID**.
* Root’s UID is always **0**.
* If the script is not run as root (UID not 0), it prints an error and exits with status `1`.

---

```bash
if [[ "${#}" -lt 1 ]]; then
  echo "Usage: ${0} USER_NAME [COMMENT]..."
  echo "Create a user with name USER_NAME and optional COMMENT."
  exit 1
fi
```

* `${#}` = total number of arguments passed to the script.
* If fewer than **1 argument** is given, it shows help/usage message and exits.
* `${0}` = script name.

---

```bash
USER_NAME="${1}"
```

* The **first argument** passed is stored as the **username**.

---

```bash
shift
COMMENT="${@}"
```

* `shift` removes the first argument (username), so now only the extra arguments remain.
* `${@}` = all remaining arguments.
* These are saved in **COMMENT**, which will be stored as the **account description**.

---

```bash
PASSWORD=$(date +%s%N)
```

* This generates a password based on the **current date + nanoseconds**.
* Example: `1680344598842862051`
* Ensures uniqueness each time the script runs.

---

```bash
useradd -c "${COMMENT}" -m ${USER_NAME}
```

* Creates a new user:

  * `-c "${COMMENT}"` = adds the comment (like full name / description).
  * `-m` = ensures a **home directory** is created.

---

```bash
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "The account could not be created."
  exit 1
fi
```

* `$?` = exit status of the **last command**.
* If user creation (`useradd`) failed, it prints an error and exits.

---

```bash
echo ${PASSWORD} | passwd --stdin ${USER_NAME} &>/dev/null
```

* Sets the generated password for the user.
* `--stdin` lets `passwd` read the password from **standard input**.
* `&>/dev/null` hides any output (makes it silent).

---

```bash
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Password could not be set."
  exit 1
fi
```

* If setting the password fails, exit with error.

---

```bash
passwd -e ${USER_NAME} &>/dev/null
```

* Forces the user to **change the password on first login**.

---

```bash
echo
echo "Username: ${USER_NAME}"
echo "Password: ${PASSWORD}"
echo "Host: $(hostname)"
```

* Prints the new **username, password, and the system hostname**.
* `$(hostname)` = machine name where the account was created.

---

### 🔑 Example Run:

```bash
sudo ./create_user.sh Alex "Test User"
```

Output:

```
Username: Alex
Password: 1680344598842862051
Host: server1
```
