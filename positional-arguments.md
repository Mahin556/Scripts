* `"$*"` → All arguments quoted into **one string**.
* `"$@"` → All arguments quoted **individually** (preferred in loops).
* `$$` → Process ID of the current script.

### 📌 Example Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "1st argument: $1"
echo "2nd argument: $2"
echo "Total arguments: $#"

echo "All arguments using * : $*"
echo "All arguments using @ : $@"

echo "Quoted * : \"$*\""
echo "Quoted @ : \"$@\""

for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "Argument: $arg"
done
```

Run with:

```bash
./myscript.sh apple banana "cherry pie"
```

Output:

```
Script name: ./myscript.sh
1st argument: apple
2nd argument: banana

Output:-
```
Looping with "$*":
[1 2 3 4]
```

```
echo 'Looping with "$@":'
for arg in "$@"; do
